.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B logcheck
program helps spot problems and
security violations in your logfiles automatically and will send the
results to you periodically in an e-mail. By default logcheck runs as
an hourly cronjob just off the hour and after every reboot.
.br
.B logcheck
supports three level of filtering:
"paranoid" is for high-security machines running as few services
as possible. Don't use it if you can't handle its verbose messages.
"server" is the default and contains rules for many different daemons.
"workstation" is for sheltered machines and filters most of the messages.
The ignore rules work in additive manner. "paranoid" rules are also
included at level "server". "workstation" level includes both "paranoid"
and "server" rules.
.br
The messages reported are sorted into three layers, system events,
security events and attack alerts. The verbosity of system events is
controlled by which level you choose, paranoid, server or workstation.
However, security events and attack alerts are not affected by this.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B logcheck
can be invoked directly thanks
to su(8) or sudo(8), which change the user ID.
The following example checks the logfiles
without updating the offset and outputs everything to STDOUT.
